Armwrestling Bracket Software

The following is my attempt at coding a armwrestling tournament using python and tkinter. Within the local armwrestling scene in Vermont there have been requests for some for an
easier way to run armwrestling tournaments. Currently most are using pencil and paper which I believe could be improved by having an application to run the tournaments in.

Currently the project is still in development. But if one would like to run the software they must just download all the Bracket files, the Tournament file, and the main file. Then
Within your own IDE you can run the project.
